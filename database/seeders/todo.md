## The movies Api
The aim is to build a simple movie api where any user can have access to and interact with. Let's make it functional first.

##The movie api should have the following 
title','year','runtime','genre','synopsis','poster_url','directors','casts',
        'writers','rating','trailer_url','release_date','production_company',

Get api from tmdb
