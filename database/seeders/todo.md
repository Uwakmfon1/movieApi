## The movies Api
The aim is to build a simple movie api where any user can have access to and interact with. Let's make it functional first.



Get api from tmdb                           - Done
Fetch it to your laravel app                - Done
Display it on postman                       - Done


### Movie Retrieval:

## By ID: 
    Allow fetching details of a specific movie using its unique identifier.  -------

## By Title (with optional filters): 
    Allow searching for movies by title, with options to filter by genre, release date, etc.

## Popular Movies: 
    Provide a way to retrieve a list of popular or top-rated movies.

## Upcoming Releases: 
    Allow fetching upcoming movies.

##### Additional Functionalities (Optional):

## Cast & Crew Information: Include details about actors, directors, and other crew members in the movie data.

## Reviews: Integrate reviews from external sources (if available through the chosen data source).

## Recommendations: Allow fetching movie recommendations based on a user's preferences (can be implemented later).

## Data Formatting:
Define a consistent format for the JSON response of your API endpoints. This ensures easy integration with frontend applications.

## Error Handling:
Implement proper error handling to provide informative messages for invalid requests, missing data, or API errors. Use HTTP status codes appropriately.

## Authentication (Optional):
Consider implementing authentication if your API offers functionalities that require user-specific data or actions (e.g., watchlists, ratings). Laravel offers built-in features like Laravel Sanctum for API authentication.

## Documentation:
Provide clear API documentation for developers using your API. This should include details about endpoints, request parameters, expected responses, and error codes. Tools like Swagger can be helpful for generating API documentation.

## Security:
Follow Laravel security best practices to protect your API from vulnerabilities like unauthorized access and SQL injection.
